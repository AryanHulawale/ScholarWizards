            <h2>A. Tips to write English Paper <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right fa-fade"></i></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Presentation is important</h3>
            <p>Maintain an appropriate pace and handwriting throughout the paper. A good Presentation will certainly
                cast a good impression on the Moderator. You may underline the bullet points you wish to make – this
                saves a lot of Moderator's time. Attempt all the questions in a proper sequence- section a, section b
                and section c. This will help alot.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. First Impression</h3>
            <p>First Impression is very important as your first page puts good or bad impact on Moderator. Moderator
                will judge you by looking at your first page; Thus keep first page neat and clean. First Impression will
                help
                you the most in language paper to score good marks.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Answer to the point</h3>
            <p>Write answer to the point, don't over exeed any of the topic in the answers. Don't think that Quantity of
                the answer will help to score good marks. If you over exeed any topic then Moderator will deduct your
                marks.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Quantity < Quality </h3>
                    <p>Quality of the answers is more important than answer's length. Here is example of This ex:-
                        a. Water is very important resource. We should save it. We should use it properly |
                        b. Water is our Biological need. There is only 3% fresh water; out of which 2% is covered with
                        glacier. Here 'b' will get more Marks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>5. Highlight Keywords</h3>
                    <p>You may underline the bullet points you wish to make – this saves a lot of Moderator's
                        time. Highlight the important points like main event in poem appreciation, story, report and
                        other Writing Skills topics.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>6. Don't Attempt the unknown topics first</h3>
                    <p>If you don't know any of the question of a section ex:-poetry then attempt it at last ( jo nahi
                        atta last me attempt karo ). If you attempt unknown topics first then it will create bad
                        impression on Moderator and he will deduct your marks further. I got huge help due to
                        this in Hindi subject.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>7. Avoid Spelling Mistakes</h3>
                    <p>If your answer is very good but it contains spelling mistakes then it can spoil your whole
                        answer. If you don't know spelling of any of the word then use similar word of it but avoid
                        spelling mistakes. Thus practice it and try to avoid it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>8. Flow of Language</h3>
                    <p>Maintain the flow of the language; don't change the topic immediately. Slowly change the topic to
                        the topic which is related to that. This trick will be Helpful in Writing Skills.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>9. Use Rough Paper to Write Ideas</h3>
                    <p>Before writing any topic of Writing Skill write down ideas on rough paper and then start writing
                        Writing Skill. This will help to improve writing Accuracy.</p>
