            <h2>A. Tips to write Science Paper <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right fa-fade"></i></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Presentation is important</h3>
            <p>Maintain an appropriate pace and handwriting throughout the paper. A good Presentation will certainly
                cast a good impression on the Moderator. You may underline the bullet points you wish to make â€“ this
                saves a lot of Moderator's time. Attempt all the questions in a proper sequence- section a, section b
                and section c.This will help alot.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Try to Attempt Full Paper</h3>
            <p>Try to Attempt full paper with options as Science paper is too short. Even I covered my Science paper 45
                minutes before and started to solve extra questions. This will help to be on safe side.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Be Careful While Solving Numericals</h3>
            <p>Stay careful with Numericals as even sign can be responsible for losing marks or the whole sum. Use
                proper values and signs especially of (g). Underline the units while reading question. Write in detail
                about each step and formula that you are using and give proper Conclusion.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Highlight Keywords</h3>
            <p>You must underline the bullet points. This saves a lot of Moderator's time. Highlight the important
                points like main answers.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>5. Marks Breakdown List</h3>
            <p>Remember that Examiners and Moderators have marks breakdown list. In that list everything is written how
                to cut marks. There are many places in which marks can be cut; So try to write each answer in detail.
                ex:-</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Use Rough Paper to Write Ideas</h3>
            <p>Before writing any topic of Writing Skill write down ideas on rough paper and then start writing Writing
                Skill. This will help to improve writing Accuracy </p>

            <h2>B. Preperation Tips<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right fa-fade"></i></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Try to Write Answers by your by Own</h3>
            <p>Learn concepts and try to write it by your own in own words. This will help to make answers by own
                concepts and can be really helpful in subject like Science.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Read Masterkey and Textbook</h3>
            <p>Read mastery and Textbook to understand indepth concepts. Underline main points and learn each table in
                Textbook and Masterkey. Learn the Textbook and Masterkey in such way that there is power in each Lesson
                to create 100 MCQ's. If you have to score then you have to do it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Learn Concepts not Answers </h3>
            <p>Learn each and every concept from the Textbook. Don't learn answer, try to learn concept behind it.
                Remmember that only 10% of the Science boards paper is made on textual questions; other 90% is
                based on concepts. So try to learn concepts by making notes by your own with help of Textbook and other
                Resource.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. See One shot Lectures for every Chapter</h3>
            <p>See One shot lectures for every Chapter on youtube as each concept is thought to us in detail. Along
                with that make self notes. My personal favourite youtuber was Prath Momaya for Science.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Revision</h3>
            <p> In studying, revision will help you remember the important facts, figures, topics and methodologies that
                you studied in the past. In examinations, revision will help you be better able to answer test
                questions. You'll feel prepared.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Sample Paper Practice</h3>
            <p>Using Sample papers, students will witness a boost in confidence with regular practice,
                answering questions that they can answer and realising how well-prepared they are for the test. The
                exam Sample paper can make students prepare for board exams or any regular test convenient to
                appear.</p>

            <h2>C. How to Study?<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right fa-fade"></i>
            </h2>
            <h3>1. Complete your syllabus in detail</h3>
            <p>Learn all the Textual answers and objectives from Textbook / Masterkey as most of paper is based on
                Textual Questions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Frequent revision</h3>
            <p>Social Science is a theoretical subject and requires time and proper break instead of practice. It is
                better to revise topics regularly. This will help in relieving the stress and relaxation for you next
                study session.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Take class text, UT, half yearly, Preboard exams seriously.</h3>
            <p>Study for every test and don't avoid it. Tests helps us to revise full syllabus and study which is as
                important as Sample paper practice.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Practice Sample papers /PYQ's</h3>
            <p>Using sample papers, you will witness a boost in confidence. With regular practice,
                answering questions you can answer and realise how well-prepared you are for the test. The
                exam sample paper can make you well-prepared for board exams or any regular test convenient to
